# Frida

Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security
researchers. Learn more at [www.frida.re](https://www.frida.re/).

Two ways to install
===

## 1. Install from prebuilt binaries

This is the recommended way to get started. All you need to do is:

    pip install frida-tools # CLI tools
    pip install frida       # Python bindings
    npm install frida       # Node.js bindings

You may also download pre-built binaries for various operating systems from
Frida's [releases](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases) page on GitHub.

## 2. Build your own binaries

### Dependencies

For running the Frida CLI tools, i.e. `frida`, `frida-ls-devices`, `frida-ps`,
`frida-kill`, `frida-trace`, and `frida-discover`, you need Python plus a
few packages:

    pip3 install colorama prompt-toolkit pygments

### Linux

    make

### macOS and iOS

First make a trusted code-signing certificate. You can use the guide at
https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/PermissionsDarwin in the sections
"Create a certificate in the System Keychain" and "Trust the certificate
for code signing". You can use the name `frida-cert` instead of `gdb-cert`
if you'd like.

Next export the name of the created certificate to the environment
variables `MAC_CERTID` and `IOS_CERTID` and run `make`:

    export MAC_CERTID=frida-cert
    export IOS_CERTID=frida-cert
    make

To ensure that macOS accepts the newly created certificate, restart the
`taskgated` daemon:

    sudo killall taskgated

### Windows

    frida.sln

(Requires Visual Studio 2017.)
